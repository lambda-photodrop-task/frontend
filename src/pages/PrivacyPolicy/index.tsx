    <p css={css.text}>
      Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to
      understand how we collect, use, and disclose information that we receive through our Service. The FOM Online, Inc.
      (“PhotoDrop,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) website available at photodrop.me and the PhotoDrop photo finding service
      (together, the “Service”) are owned and operated by PhotoDrop. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third
      party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Service. Also, please note that,
      unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same
      meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>User Consent</b>
      <br />
      By accessing or otherwise using the Service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the
      associated Terms of Service (set forth on PhotoDrop) you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal
      Information (as defined below) and Anonymous Information (as defined below) according to this Privacy Policy.
      <br /> <br />
      Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected and transferred to, and
      maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country (including the United States), or other
      governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent
      than the laws in your country. If you&apos;re located outside the United States and choose to provide your
      Personal Information to us, we may transfer your Personal Information to the United States and process it there.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Regarding Children</b>
      <br />
      Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Service and we do not intentionally collect or maintain
      Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important
      to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user&apos;s
      Personal Information from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their
      parent&apos;s permission before submitting information over the internet. By using the Service, you are
      representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents&apos;
      permission to use the Service.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Collection and Use of Information</b>
      <br />
      Our Service is designed to help you more easily identify photos of yourself, to share those photos with other
      users, and to connect and share photos with friends and other users. You are in control of what information you
      share with the Service and nothing you provide is automatically shared with others unless you tell PhotoDrop via
      your settings to send photos to other users without your review. We provide you with settings to allow you to
      control your level of approval for your photos, and if you no longer want to be identified in a certain photo you
      can simply untag it.
      <br /> <br />
      Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Service, to administer your use of the
      Service (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our
      Service.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Personal Information</b>
      <br />
      In general, we collect information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, and phone
      number (“Personal Information”) that you submit to us voluntarily through the Service, including Personal
      information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your Account and user profile on the Service.
      For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, mobile phone number,
      valid email address and password of your choice.
      <br /> <br />
      When you personalize your profile and use the features of the Service, we will collect any Personal Information
      you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional non-personal information to support your use of the
      Service, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We refer to such information as
      “Anonymous Information” because it cannot be used by itself to identify you and therefore is not Personal
      Information. We collect information in the form of the User Content that you submit during your use of the
      Service, such as photos, comments, ratings and other information you choose to submit.
      <br /> <br />
      We also collect the information you provide when you use the Service. This can include information in or about the
      User Content you provide, such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. If you connect to us
      from a social network, we also will be able to access and collect Personal Information about you and your friends
      that your privacy settings on the social network permit us to access. For instance, we may collect your user ID or
      profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through the Service in order to display you as a
      friend or in association with your profile and collections.
      <br /> <br />
      When you order our for fee products or services, you will need to submit Personal Information such as your credit
      card number, postal address, or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment
      for those products and services. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that
      may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and all related information. Additionally, we
      collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments,
      or forums within the PhotoDrop community.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Use of Facial Recognition Data</b>
      <br /> <br />
      We do not sell, trade, or rent any Personal Information derived from our use of facial recognition technology. As
      detailed below, we use a variety of reasonable, industry-standard security technologies and administrative,
      physical, and electronic procedures to help protect your Personal Information, including information derived from
      our use of facial recognition technology, from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We may provide secure
      access to this information with third-party service providers who work on our behalf to administer and provide
      certain components or features of the Service.
      <br /> <br />
      We will retain and store Personal Information derived from the facial recognition technology for as long as you
      have an active Account on the Service. Personal Information derived from facial recognition technology will be
      deleted or destroyed through a secure manner. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we might have
      inadvertently collected any personal information from your child under the age of 13 through the Service, please
      contact us at hello@photodrop.me to request that information be deleted or destroyed.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Device Information</b>
      <br />
      We collect information from and about the computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access the
      Service, depending on the permissions you have granted. We may associate the information we collect from your
      different devices to provide a better or more consistent experience. Information we may collect includes device
      identifiers, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our
      Service.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Location Information</b>
      <br />
      When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into
      a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device&apos;s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable
      location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Service for you,
      such as to identify photos of you near a particular location. If you do not want us to collect location
      information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device. However, if you disable the location services
      feature on your mobile device after using the App, we cannot remove any historic location data unless you delete
      your Account.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Personal Information from Other Sources</b>
      <br />
      We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies with
      whom we have partnered with or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal
      Information we have collected about you.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>E-mail and Email Addresses</b>
      <br />
      If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our “Feedback” form through the Service, we will collect your e-mail
      address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may
      use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through the
      Service or the social network from which you have connected to the Service (such as in an invitation, or when
      sharing your content). Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as
      when someone sends you a personal message) or notifications from a social network or other website with whom you
      have registered to receive such notifications. We may use this e-mail address to contact you, for things such as
      notifications of limited edition shop sales and other related information. You may indicate your preference to
      stop receiving further promotional communications as further detailed below.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Information Collected Automatically</b>
      <br />
      As you use the Service, certain information about how a person uses our Service may also be passively collected
      and stored on our or our service providers&apos; server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser
      type, and operating system. We also use navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather
      information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and
      viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Service you clicked. This type of information is
      collected to administer the Service, to make the Service more useful to you, to tailor your experience with the
      Service to meet your special interests and needs, and to analyze (and have third parties analyze) the information
      to improve, customize and enhance our Service.
      <br /> <br />
      An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when
      you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if
      you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example,
      we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access the Service to assist with ad targeting.
      <br /> <br />
      “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer&apos;s hard drive while you are
      viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
      Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to tell us how and when you interact with our
      Services, to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Service, to improve our Service, and to
      provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Service. Persistent Cookies can be removed by
      following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our Service, your web browser must accept
      Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects or features of the Service may not work properly, and you
      will not be able to receive our Service.
      <br /> <br />
      We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing
      advertisements on the Service. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or “Web Beacons” (which are
      usually small, transparent graphic images). Web Beacons are used in order to deliver or communicate Cookies, to
      track and measure the performance of our Service, to monitor how many visitors view our Service, and to monitor
      information related to the effectiveness of served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you
      to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and Web
      Beacons and does not cover the use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and other privacy practices of any advertisers or ad
      servers.
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Use and Disclosure of Information</b>
      <br />
      Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not generally sell, trade, rent, or share your Personal
      Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
      <br /> <br />
      In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to provide you access to the Service, to improve
      the Service, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of the Service and to offer you additional
      information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request.
      Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network from which you
      have connected to the Service, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information
      with.
      <br /> <br />
      We may provide your Personal Information to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to
      administer and provide some of the services and features of the Service and to help us communicate with you.
      Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing
      payments (including credit card payments), quality control (such as manually or mechanically comparing reference
      images with photo matches to determine the accuracy of matches), creating biometric identifiers and providing
      customer service. We require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as
      necessary to provide the relevant services to us and not to disclose or use your Personal Information for any
      other purpose. We may also share aggregated information and Anonymous Information with third parties for research
      and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.
      <br /> <br />
      We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our third-party partners, those with whom we have a
      co-branding or promotional relationship, or other third-parties about whom you are otherwise notified and do not
      request to opt out of such sharing. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your Person Information by such
      third-parties. We do not maintain responsibility for the manner in which third parties, including, without
      limitation, social networks, other partners and advertisers, use or further disclose Personal Information
      collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, after we have disclosed such information to those third
      parties. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the manners
      identified in this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Service.
      <br /> <br />
      Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a
      common control, we may in the future, and we may share some or all of your Personal Information with these
      companies, in which case we will require them to honour this Privacy Policy.
      <br /> <br />
      Information that we collect from our users, including Personal Information, is considered a business asset. In the
      event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a
      portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such
      transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy.
      <br /> <br />
      We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
      We may disclose your Personal Information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if we
      believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to (a) comply with relevant laws and to
      stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity; (b) to respond to claims,
      subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (c) to protect and defend our rights, property, and safety and the rights,

      circumstances described herein.

      <br />
